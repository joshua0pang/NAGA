This game is inspired by calculator snake games from my High School Algebra type classes.

I am hoping to make it work in the console only, but in the canvas is okay if only way.

Included in failures is a proof of concept remix of the snake game Dr. Jhala posted. I think I called it EKANS which is snake backwards.
